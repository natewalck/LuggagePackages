Required:

The Luggage - https://github.com/unixorn/luggage/wiki
Xcode (For the Make functionality)
Makefile - https://github.com/natewalck/LuggagePackages/tree/master/LabStats

Directions:
1.  Clone this git repo to your local machine.

2.  Put the new OS X native LabStats installer in the same directory as the Makefile.  It *MUST* be named labstats-osxPkg-installer.pkg

3.  Edit the host.txt file in the root of labstats-osxPkg-installer.pkg and make sure that it matches your server ip/port.

4.  Edit the Makefile and make sure the PACKAGE_VERSION number is correct.  (I have put the most current version in, but it will obviously change over time).

5.  From Terminal, cd into the directory where you put the Makefile and type 'make pkg'.

6.  It *should* spit out a proper Apple Package and be good to go.
